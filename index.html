            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Q1: What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
            <p>Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources, such as servers,
                storage, databases, and applications, over the internet. Rather than owning and maintaining physical
                hardware or software, users rent these resources from cloud service providers on-demand.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                <li>Flexibility: Users can rent resources as needed without paying upfront costs.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Resources like computing power, storage, and networking can be easily increased or
                    decreased based on demand.</li>
                <li>Cost-effectiveness: Users only pay for the resources they use, which reduces unnecessary costs.</li>
                <li>Efficiency: Cloud computing enables faster setup, development, and management of applications and
                    services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Vision of Cloud Computing:</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                <li>On-demand Access: Cloud computing allows users to quickly rent virtual resources, such as hardware,
                    storage, and services, and manage them online without paying upfront.</li>
                <li>Utility-based Model: In the future, cloud services could be traded like utilities (similar to
                    electricity and water), where companies and customers can easily buy and sell services as needed.
                </li>
                <li>Support for Developers: Developers can rent extra storage or computing power without owning the
                    infrastructure, making it easier to build and run applications.</li>
                <li>Green IT: Companies can handle data centers in a better way (optimizing), saving energy and reducing
                    carbon emissions, contributing to a greener IT ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Q2: How is Cloud Computing Helping Organizations?</h3>
            <p>Cloud computing is transforming the way enterprises, governments, and other organizations build and
                manage their computing resources. It makes access to resources as easy as performing a credit card
                transaction online. Here are practical examples of how cloud computing benefits different sectors:</p>

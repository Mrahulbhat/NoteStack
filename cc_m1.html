                <p class="mt-2 text-lg">Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing
                    resources,
                    such as servers, storage, databases, and applications, over the internet. Rather than owning and
                    maintaining physical hardware or software, users rent these resources from cloud service providers
                    on-demand.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                    <li>Flexibility: Users can rent resources as needed without paying upfront costs.</li>
                    <li>Scalability: Resources like computing power, storage, and networking can be easily increased or
                        decreased based on demand.</li>
                    <li>Cost-effectiveness: Users only pay for the resources they use, which reduces unnecessary costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Efficiency: Cloud computing enables faster setup, development, and management of applications

                    <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong>: Provides virtual hardware (servers,

                    of distributed systems that led to the evolution of Cloud Computing.</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-lg"><strong>Ans:</strong> A distributed system is a collection of independent
                    computers that appears to users as a single, unified system. These computers work together to
                    perform tasks, share resources, and process information, but they operate independently and are
                    located in different places.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">The 3 Major Milestones leading to cloud computing are:</h4>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mainframe Computing:</strong>
                        <p class="mt-2">These were the first examples of large computational systems. Mainframes were
                            powerful, highly reliable computers specialized for large data movement and massive
                            input/output (I/O) operations. They were mostly used by large organizations for bulk data
                            processing tasks such as online transactions, enterprise resource planning, and other
                            operations involving the processing of significant amounts of data.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Cluster Computing (1980s):</strong>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Cluster computing came as a cheaper alternative to
                            mainframes and supercomputers. It connects many smaller, inexpensive computers (called a
                            cluster) through a fast network, allowing them to work together as one powerful system.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Contribution:</strong> Cluster computing allowed tasks to be processed
                            faster and more efficiently by sharing the workload across many machines. It introduced the
                            idea of using multiple computers together, which is a key concept in cloud computing.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Grid Computing:</strong>
                        <p class="mt-2">Grid computing built on cluster computing by linking computers across different
                            locationsâ€”sometimes across countries or even the world. This created access to much greater
                            computing power and storage, making it possible to solve more complex problems.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Contribution:</strong> Grid computing introduced the idea of sharing
                            resources on a large scale and using them only when needed. This idea is central to modern
                            cloud computing, where resources like storage and computing power can be accessed on demand.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Key Developments:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Clusters became common: Many organizations started using clusters, so the technology
                                became widely available.</li>
                            <li>Underutilized clusters: Often, these clusters werenâ€™t fully used, leaving room for
                                improvement.</li>
                            <li>Need for more power: Certain problems needed more computational power than a single
                                cluster could handle, driving the need for larger grids.</li>
                            <li>Better networking and Internet: Advances in network technology and the rise of the
                                Internet made it possible to connect computers over long distances with fast,
                                high-bandwidth connections.</li>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Q9: Explain Web 2.0 and its significance in cloud computing.</h3>

                <p class="mt-2 text-lg">The web is a key way that cloud computing provides its services. Today, the web
                    includes various technologies and services that enable interactive information sharing,
                    collaboration, user-centered design, and application building. This change is known as Web 2.0,
                    which represents a new way for developers to create applications and deliver services online,
                    improving the experience for users.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">Key Features of Web 2.0:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                    <li><strong>Interactivity and Flexibility:</strong> Web 2.0 adds interactivity to web pages,
                        allowing users to access features typically found in desktop applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technologies:</strong> This is made possible by combining standards and technologies
                        like XML, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), and web services. These tools enable
                        developers to create applications that rely on user input, turning users into content creators.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Applications:</strong> Web 2.0 applications are very dynamicâ€”they continuously
                        improve and regularly integrate new updates and features based on how the community uses them.
                        Thereâ€™s no need to install new software on usersâ€™ devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> These applications aim to reach a wide range of internet users
                        by being accessible in terms of media and cost.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">Examples of Web 2.0 Applications:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                    <li>Google Docs</li>
                    <li>Google Maps</li>
                    <li>Flickr</li>
                    <li>Facebook</li>
                    <li>Twitter</li>
                    <li>YouTube</li>
                    <li>Delicious</li>
                    <li>Blogger</li>
                    <li>Wikipedia</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-2 text-lg">Social networking sites, in particular, benefit greatly from Web 2.0. The level
                    of interaction seen on sites like Facebook and Flickr relies on technologies like AJAX and RSS
                    (Really Simple Syndication), which make the user experience much more engaging.</p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-lg">The idea of the web as a tool that enhances interaction was introduced by Darcy
                    DiNucci in 1999 and became fully realized around 2004. Today, it serves as a strong foundation for
                    cloud computing, which heavily relies on Web 2.0. Applications and frameworks that provide rich
                    internet applications (RIAs) are essential for making cloud services accessible to everyone.</p>

                        <strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong>
                        <p class="mt-2">QoS refers to a set of attributes that measure how well a service performs. This
                            includes:</p>

                        <p class="mt-2">SaaS is a delivery model where software applications are provided over the
                            internet. Instead of buying and installing software, users can access it on a subscription
                            or rental basis from a central data center. This concept was inspired by Application Service
                            Providers (ASPs), which made software available via the web.</p>
